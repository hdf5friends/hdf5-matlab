HDF5 Friends Group
-----------------------------
The aim of the group is to promote a wider adoption of the **[HDF5 file format](http://www.hdfgroup.org)** in brain imaging, to broaden uses and possibilities than currently afforded with popular formats.

There is a lot of work to do, and the idea is to keep it all publicly available as the implementation evolves from its very initial pieces.
